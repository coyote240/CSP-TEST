      <h1>Understanding Content Security Policy</h1>

      <p class="overview">
      The purpose of this site is to demonstrate the effects of various Content
      Security Policies (CSP) when applied to a single HTML document. This page
      has been deployed to a number of directories with different CSP configured,
      accessible via links below. Each policy will affect this page's behavior in
      specific ways, which we will describe.
      </p>

    <section class="x-xss-protection">
      <h2>X-XSS-Protection</h2>

      <p>
      This page has been delivered with an X-XSS-Protection header. While this
      header has been recommended in the past, it is in fact unsupported in all
      modern browsers. The X-XSS-Protection header had been implemented in
      Internet Explorer and Safari, but was only briefly supported by Google
      Chrome and was never implemented by Firefox. Instead, a strong Content
      Security Policy is recommended, which will be discussed in further detail
      below.
      </p>

      <p>
      In order to demonstrate that the X-XSS-Protection header does not, in
      fact, prevent XSS, click the link below which exploits an XSS
      vulnerability built into this page.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="/x-xss-protection-block/?query=%3Cimg%20src=%27null%27%20onerror=alert('XSS')%3E">Click Me!</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      As you can see, X-XSS-Protection may no longer be considered adequate
      protection for client sites. Instead, let's begin to put together a
      Content Security Policy that provides adequate protection while meeting
      the needs of the application.

      <h2>A Lack of Content Security Policy</h2>

      <p>
      This page has been delivered without a Content Security Policy (CSP).
      Without a CSP, JavaScript, CSS, fonts and other objects may be downloaded
      and run from any source. This leaves a site open to potential Cross-site
      scripting attacks which could then also include payloads downloaded from
      report sources.
      </p>

      <p>
      Take a moment to open your browser's Developer Tools and note that this
      site includes fonts and scripts from Google.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the past it was common to recommend the use of the X-XSS-Protection
      header to help mitigate the threat of Cross Site Scripting. Click the
      link below to view this page as delivered with an X-XSS-Protection
      header.

    <section class="directives">
      <h2>Directives and Sources</h2>

      <noscript>
      When the Content-Security-Policy is set to default-src 'none', no script
      origin is acceptable and JavaScript will not run on the page.
      </noscript>

      <p>
      default-src 'self' will allow scripts downloaded from the same origin as the page,
      but prevent scripts from third-party domains and inline scripts.
      </p>

      <p>
      Using default-src 'unsafe-inline' only will prevent scripts other than inline
      javascript from being downloaded or executed
      </p>
